# Amazon Timestream Sink for Apache Flink

Write records to Timestream from Flink.

----
## Overview

This is the root directory for samples which show you end-to-end process of working with Kinesis and Timestream.
The directory contains:
 - [sample data generator](/integrations/flink_connector/sample-data-generator) - python script which generates and ingests sample data to Kinesis
 - [sample Kinesis to Timestream Application](/integrations/flink_connector/sample-kinesis-to-timestream-app) - sample Flink application which reads records from Kinesis and uses the Timestream Sink to ingest data to Timestream
 - [Amazon Timestream Flink Sink](/integrations/flink_connector/flink-connector-timestream) - Timestream Flink Sink as Maven module

## Getting Started

### 1. Install prerequisites

 - Java 11 is the recommended version for using Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink Application. If you have multiple Java versions ensure to export Java 11 to your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
 - Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). You can test your Apache Maven install with the following command:
```
mvn -version
```

### 2. Setup Environment

1. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream with the name "TimestreamTestStream". You can use the below AWS CLI command:
```
aws kinesis create-stream --stream-name TimestreamTestStream --shard-count 1
```

2. Install Timestream Sink, so it's available for other applications as Maven module:
```shell
cd flink-connector-timestream
mvn clean compile && mvn install
```

### 3 (option A). Run Sample Flink Application locally
1. Compile and run the sample application. The application will create target Timestream database/table upon launch automatically, and will start pooling records from Kinesis and writing them to Timestream:
```
cd ../sample-kinesis-to-timestream-app
mvn clean compile && mvn package
mvn install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.amazonaws.samples.kinesis2timestream.StreamingJob" -Dexec.args="--InputStreamName TimestreamTestStream --Region us-east-1 --TimestreamDbName kdaflink --TimestreamTableName kinesisdata" -Dexec.classpathScope=test
```

2. Follow **Getting Started** section from [sample data generator](/integrations/flink_connector/sample-data-generator) to send records to Kinesis.
3. The records now should be consumed by the sample application and written to Timestream table.
4. Query Timestream table using [AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/console_timestream.html#console_timestream.queries.using-console) or AWS CLI:
```
aws timestream-query query --query-string "SELECT * FROM kdaflink.kinesisdata WHERE time >= ago (15m) LIMIT 10"
```

## 3 (option B). Run Sample Flink Application on Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics
1. Compile the sample application:
```shell
cd ../sample-kinesis-to-timestream-app
mvn clean compile && mvn package
```
2. Upload Flink Application Jar file to S3 bucket: 
```shell
cd ../sample-kinesis-to-timestream-app
aws s3 cp target/sample-kinesis-to-timestream-app-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/sample-kinesis-to-timestream-app-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
3. Follow the steps in [Create and Run the Kinesis Data Analytics Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/get-started-exercise.html#get-started-exercise-7)
 - pick Apache Flink version 1.13.2
 - in "Edit the IAM Policy" step, add Timestream Write permissions to the created policy

4. Follow **Getting Started** section from [sample data generator](/integrations/flink_connector/sample-data-generator) to send records to Kinesis.
5. The records now should be consumed by the sample application and written to Timestream table.
6. Query Timestream table using [AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/console_timestream.html#console_timestream.queries.using-console) or AWS CLI:
```
aws timestream-query query --query-string "SELECT * FROM kdaflink.kinesisdata WHERE time >= ago (15m) LIMIT 10"
```
