# Note:
Code in this folder and subfolders is available in Flink 1.15+, but as of now (12/2021) Amazon Kinesis supports Flink version 1.13.2.

In future, this folder should be removed and classes should implement upstream Flink classes. Therefore, minimal changes were done to port the original code to older Flink version.
